## My process

  1. Created an environment of TypeScript/TailwindCSS, though unnecessary, to build/practice with.
  2. Learned about transitioning from vanilla css to tailwind.
  3. Componentized the blog preview card.
  4. Developed the blog preview card together with figma for accuracy.
  5. Publish.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS] (https://tailwindcss.com/) 
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

A lot about tailwindCSS, without much for typescript/react.

### Continued development

Hopefully, in future projects, i'll do challenges that challenge the tools I try to work with.
